# Heart Disease Prediction (UCI Dataset)

## Overview
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using machine learning techniques.
The models are trained and evaluated on the UCI Heart Disease dataset and include data preprocessing,
exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and performance evaluation.

## Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Target Variable: Presence of heart disease
- Type: Structured tabular medical data

## Project Workflow
- Data loading and inspection
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection
- Model training
- Model evaluation

## Machine Learning Models
The following models were implemented and tested:
- Dummy Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/huda-alq/Heart-Disease-Prediction.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   cd Heart-Disease-Prediction
3. Install required libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook Heart_Diseases_UCI_code.ipynb


## Results: 
The models were evaluated using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall,
and confusion matrix. The results show that machine learning models can effectively assist in
predicting heart disease based on patient data

#Future Improvements:
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation
- Feature engineering
- Trying advanced models such as XGBoost
